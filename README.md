# EntityResolutionService
OERS is an ontology-aware service for identifying candidate co-references across knowledge graphs. Unlike traditional entity resolution systems that treat identity as a string-matching problem, OERS grounds identity in ontological commitments derived from the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Common Core Ontologies (CCO).
